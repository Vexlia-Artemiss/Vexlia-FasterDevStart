# Vexlia-FasterDevStart

Shortens and simplifies `(devmode) fast start` for modders who need to reload the game a lot. 

Allows for one press game start.

What mod does precisely?

- Autosets the player name as "DevMode FastStart" (Or "Devmode NexFastStart" if Nexerelin is active). **Notice: UI panel doesn't update.**
- This also allows you to click `Continue` right away. 
- Adds option on first sreeen to choice devstart, skiping pressing `Continue`.
- Skips skill point distribution screen, and gives skill points after start, if you still need them for testing.
- Features fully work with Nexerelin (and use its devmode start values).

**Changes and options only appear if devmod is active.**

Should be safe to remove at any point.
