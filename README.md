# Vexlia-FasterDevStart

Shortens and simplifies Fast Devstart for modders who need to reload the game a lot.

Doesnâ€™t fully work with nexerelin, but allows you to skip clicking Random to get a name.

ATTENTION: MOD ONLY WORKS IF YOU SWAP VANILLA PLUGIN WITH MINE IN \starsector-core\data\config\setting.json
For best experience use lines from bellow:

```
		#"newGameDialogPlugin":"com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.NewGameDialogPluginImpl",
		"newGameDialogPlugin":"Vexlia.VFDS.Plugins.Vexlia_NewGameDialogPluginImpl",
```
