# Vexlia-FasterDevStart

Shortens and simplifies `(devmode) fast start` for modders who need to reload the game a lot. 

Allows for one press game start.

What mod does precisely?

- Autosets the player name as "DevMode FastStart" (Or Devmode "NexFastStart" if nexerelin is active). **Notice: UI panels don't update.**
- Adds option on first sreeen to choice devstart, skiping pressing `Continue`.
- This also allows you to click `Continue` right away. 
- Skips skill point distribution screen, and gives skill points after start, if you still need them for testing.

**Changes and options only appear if devmod is active.**

Fully works with Nexerelin. Should be save to remove at any point.
