# Vexlia-FasterDevStart

Shortens and simplifies `(devmode) fast start` for modders who need to reload the game a lot. 

Mod autosets the player name as "DevMode FastStart", it just UI panels don't update. 
You can overwrite the name, as it is set only if the current name is empty. T
his also allows you to click `Continue` right away. 
Also skips skill point distribution screen, and gives skill points after start, if you still need them for testing. 

**Changes and options only appear if devmod is active.**

Fully work with Nexerelin. Mod is utility.
